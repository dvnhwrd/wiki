# Complete JS Course Notes
## From Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann

### Section 2: JS Fundamentals Part 1
 - HTML - is responsible for the content
 - CSS - Presentation
 - JS - Real programming language to build web applications
 - Link JS files with `<script ref>` at the **end** of the `<body>` tag
   - #new
 - A value is a basic piece of data
 - You can store values in variables so you can use them later
 - _ and $ are the only symbols you can use in variables
 - while name is allowed as a variable it can cause issues
 - variables in caps are reserved for constants
 - Use descriptive names with variables
 - **Data Types**
   - Primitive Data Types
      - Numbers are always floating point numbers
         - no int seperation
      - Strings are a sequence of characters
      - Boolean are only logical types
      - Undefined (self explanitory)
      - Null also means 'empty value'
      - Symbol value that is unique and cannot be changed
      - Bingint - large numbers
   - JS is dynamically typed, which means it doesn't need to be typed
   - `typeof` - operator that shows you the type
      - `typeof null` will return object, but this is a bug
 - **Comments**
   - `//` single line comment
   - `/*` start a multi-line comment
   - `*/` end a multi-line comment
   - Can use ctrl + / in VSCode to comment out sections
 - **let, const, and var**
   - `let` allows a variable to be changed later
      - Can use it to declare an empty variable
   - `const` variables cannot be changed
      - you will get a variable if you try and reassign it
      - it turns it into an immutable item
      - must have an initial value
   - Use `const` by default
   - `var` is a legacy term
      - works similar to let, but don't use it
   - you don't have to declare variables?? but dont, it will make it global
 - **Basic Operators**
   - Operators allow you to mutate code?
   - think `+-/*`
   - `**` to the power of
   - can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings
   - comparison operators always return boolean values
 - **Operator Precedence**
   - MDN has a list
   - Math operators are done before comparison operators
   - Assignment operators go last
