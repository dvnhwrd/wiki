# Planning for the linux section

#### Readme.md
 Use this to list out different commands (like a cheatsheet) with each command linked to a page with more information.

EX. 
Command | Uses
------- | ----
`cd` | change directory

Do something like this with the `cd` being a link to cd.md. 

After these sections just have a list with different topics that aren't command based.

#### Command Pages
Create a documentation like page that explains not only what the command is used for, but also gives all of the extras and their uses

#### Topic Pages
These will be lists of certain things that may come up that aren't specifically command based.

#### Pages to go:
 - [ ] `cd`
 - [ ] `mkdir`
 - [ ] `rm`
 - [ ] `ls`
 - [ ] `mv`
