# General Planning

What if I just took my notes in a seperate file then added them later in a more organized fashion. I think this will work better than trying just to add them as I go.

Maybe I can create a folder for book notes, and create a new note for each book/course/? I go to.

Alright, I'm moving my set up over. While I like using WSL, it isn't as quick and easy as I'd hope. Hmm...I do wonder how this will work with my note taking since it can only have one folder open at a time. Oh shit! I can add an extra folder to my workspace. Hot diggity damn! THis is how I'll do it! I think this will work out best and be easest.
